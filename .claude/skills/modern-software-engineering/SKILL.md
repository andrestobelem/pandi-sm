# Modern Software Engineering

Use this skill when a task asks for software engineering judgment: architecture, refactoring, code review, test strategy, delivery/process improvements, workflow design, or deciding whether a change is worth making.

This skill is based on the project research distilled from Dave Farley’s _Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster_ and related notes. See `references/dave-farley-modern-software-engineering.md` for the compact source summary.

## Core lens

Modern software engineering is practical science applied to software development:

1. **Optimize for learning.** Treat each change as a hypothesis and seek the fastest high-quality feedback.
2. **Use TDD for behavior changes.** Start with a failing executable check, make it pass with the smallest change, then refactor while preserving green tests.
3. **Manage complexity.** Keep systems understandable enough to change safely.
4. **Use evidence.** Prefer tests, CI output, runtime observations, and preserved artifacts over fashion, authority, intuition, or AI consensus.
5. **Judge by stability and throughput.** A practice is useful when it improves quality/reliability/recovery and/or frequent efficient delivery without hurting the other dimension.

## TDD as the default feedback loop

For behavior-changing work, prefer TDD as the first learning mechanism:

1. **Name the behavior or risk being learned.** What uncertainty are we reducing?
2. **Red:** write or describe the smallest failing test/check that exposes it. For bugs, reproduce the bug. For refactors, add characterization tests. For new behavior, specify the expected behavior in a test.
3. **Green:** make the smallest implementation change that passes.
4. **Refactor:** improve names, boundaries, cohesion, coupling, duplication, and clarity while tests stay green.
5. **Verify:** run the relevant local checks and CI signal; capture the exact command/result when possible.

If TDD is not the right tool for the task, say why and name the replacement evidence: spike result, CI signal, runtime observation, user feedback, metric, or other executable check.

## Required response shape when using this skill

For plans, reviews, or implementation guidance, include these items unless clearly irrelevant:

- **Learning goal:** the uncertainty or risk being tested.
- **Smallest safe step:** the narrowest reversible slice.
- **TDD/feedback plan:** the failing test or check to create first, or the explicit replacement evidence.
- **Complexity check:** impact on modularity, cohesion, separation of concerns, information hiding, abstraction, and coupling.
- **Stability/throughput check:** expected effect on reliability, recovery, delivery speed, and change safety.
- **Stop condition:** what evidence is enough to proceed, stop, or roll back.

## How to apply it

When helping with a design, review, plan, implementation, or dynamic workflow:

1. **State the learning goal as a testable hypothesis.** What observation would prove it wrong?
2. **Choose the smallest useful slice.** Prefer a reversible increment, spike, or narrow workflow over a broad rewrite.
3. **Start with TDD for behavior changes.** Name the failing test, fixture, golden output, smoke check, CI signal, or measurement that will prove/disprove the hypothesis.
4. **Keep increments small and reversible.** Avoid large speculative rewrites unless measured evidence demands them.
5. **Reduce complexity deliberately.** Check modularity, cohesion, separation of concerns, information hiding, abstraction boundaries, and coupling during the refactor step, not as speculative design.
6. **Evaluate stability and throughput.** Explain expected impact on quality, reliability, recovery, deployment frequency, and delivery efficiency.
7. **Report evidence, not confidence.** End with commands, test/CI results, observed signals, or explicit uncertainty.

## Review checklist

Use these questions during code review, design review, and plan review:

- **TDD:** What failing test, characterization test, or executable check drove this change? If none, is the exception justified and what evidence replaced it?
- **Learning:** What did this change prove or disprove? Does it shorten or delay feedback?
- **Incrementality:** Can it ship or be validated in a smaller reversible slice?
- **Test quality:** Are tests fast, deterministic, meaningful, behavior-focused, maintainable, and suitable for CI?
- **Test level:** Is the behavior tested at the cheapest useful level, with integration/acceptance coverage for cross-boundary risk?
- **Deployability:** Does it preserve safe release, rollback, and recovery paths?
- **Modularity:** Are responsibilities isolated behind clear interfaces?
- **Cohesion:** Do the pieces that change together live together?
- **Coupling:** Does this introduce dependencies that make future changes expensive?
- **Information hiding:** Are internal details hidden, or are callers forced to know too much?
- **Stability:** What failure modes, reliability signals, or recovery paths changed?
- **Throughput:** Will this make future changes faster, slower, or safer?
- **Evidence:** Are claims backed by tests, commands, metrics, logs, artifacts, or concrete code evidence?

## Dynamic workflow guidance

For Pi Dynamic Workflows specifically:

- Use workflows to shorten learning loops when the work is broad, uncertain, or benefits from genuinely independent perspectives.
- Start workflow design from the test/feedback loop: what executable check or artifact will decide whether the workflow succeeded?
- Keep workflow branches independent, small, and evidence-producing. Each branch should return concrete artifacts, not just opinions.
- Persist artifacts so learning survives chat compaction: test output, failing cases, reproduction steps, synthesized decisions, rejected alternatives, and unresolved risks.
- Add synthesis-as-judge and adversarial review when correctness matters, but require executable tests or concrete evidence before accepting conclusions.
- Keep generated workflows small and task-specific until repeated evidence shows reusable value.
- Treat `maxAgents`, concurrency, model choice, stop conditions, and artifact paths as engineering controls. Set them from the learning goal, cost, risk, and verification strategy rather than copying defaults.
- Prefer one small workflow plus a fast check over a large orchestration that delays feedback or obscures responsibility.

## Anti-patterns to call out

- Implementing behavior before specifying the failing test or executable check.
- Treating TDD as optional when the task changes behavior without naming replacement evidence.
- Large speculative rewrites that postpone learning.
- Abstractions, configurability, or process added without evidence that they improve stability, throughput, or complexity control.
- Slow, flaky, overly integrated tests used where fast focused tests would work.
- Agent consensus, synthesis, or AI-generated code treated as equivalent to passing tests.
- Claims of success without commands, CI results, review evidence, metrics, or observable behavior.

## Guardrails

- Do not add bureaucracy, ceremonies, abstractions, or configurability unless they improve learning, stability, throughput, or complexity control.
- Do not optimize local speed by skipping tests or evidence.
- Do not confuse AI-generated output with correctness; require review and verification.
- If the best next step is a small test, spike, or measurement, prefer that over a grand design.
